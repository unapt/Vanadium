# Vanadium Hackathon Template

This is straight boiler-plate using:

Frontend: NextJS, Typescript, Chakra UI

Backend: FastAPI, Python

Install dependencies (you might have to run this command in both the frontend and backend)

```bash
yarn install
```

Then you can run the frontend with:

```bash
yarn workspace frontend dev
```

Then you can run the backend on a different terminal instance:

```bash
yarn workspace backend dev
```
