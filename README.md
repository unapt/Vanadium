# Vanadium Hackathon Template

This is straight boiler-plate using:

Frontend: NextJS, Typescript, Chakra UI
Backend: FastAPI, Python

Install dependencies (run this on the parent directory)

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can run the frontend with:

```bash
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev
```

Then you can run the backend on a different terminal instance:

```bash
cd packages/backend
npm run dev
```
